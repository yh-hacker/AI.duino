# HELP  
Some hints on how to use AI.duino.  
More coming soon.

## Custom OpenAI-Compatible API

AI.duino now supports custom OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, allowing you to use any AI provider that implements the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint.

### Supported Providers
* **Self-hosted LLM servers**: LocalAI, vLLM, llama.cpp server, FastChat, etc.
* **OpenAI-compatible API proxies**: Any proxy service that converts API calls to OpenAI format
* **Custom API endpoints**: Any service implementing the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` interface

### Configuration

To use a custom API endpoint, configure the following settings in AI.duino settings:

1. **Custom API Endpoint**: Enter your API base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/v1` or `https://api.example.com/v1`)
2. **Custom API Key**: Enter your API key (if required by your provider)
3. **Custom Model ID**: Enter the model identifier (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `deepseek-chat`, `my-custom-model`)

### Examples

**LocalAI**:
* Endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/v1`
* API Key: (leave empty for LocalAI)
* Model ID: `gpt-4o` (or any model you've configured)

**vLLM**:
* Endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/v1`
* API Key: (leave empty for local vLLM)
* Model ID: `your-model-name`

**API Proxy**:
* Endpoint: `https://api.your-proxy.com/v1`
* API Key: `your-proxy-api-key`
* Model ID: `target-model-name`

### Notes

* The custom API must implement the standard OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
* Streaming responses are supported if the API supports Server-Sent Events (SSE)
* If your API doesn't require an API key, leave the field empty
* Model discovery is not available for custom endpoints — you must specify the model ID manually

## Inline Completion
Clicking Inline opens the settings where inline completion can be enabled or disabled. The AI provides code suggestions while typing, triggered by keywords like Serial. and in comments ending with :. Example: ``` // Blink the LED three times: ```. Press the **Tab key** to accept the suggestion. A different provider can be configured for inline completion. **Groq** is recommended – it's free within limits and extremely fast.

## Settings  
There are several options that need further explanation. The default values are tested and work fine, but if you need some customization, here are some details.

### AI Behavior  
* **Creativity (Temperature):** Controls randomness in AI responses. Lower values (0.0–0.3) produce more focused and deterministic answers, ideal for code generation. Higher values (0.7–1.0) increase creativity and variety. Used in **Explain Code**, **Quick Question**, and **Chat (if enabled)**. Default: 0.7  
  
* **Code Temperature:** Code generation requires more precision. Used in **all other features** and **inline completion**. Default: 0.3  

* **Max. Tokens per Request:** Set the token limit for the AI response in 4 steps. 2000 is really short; 8000 is quite talkative. The selected step is shown in the tree beneath **Response length**. More than 8000 may cause errors, so it is limited. Default: 4000  

# FAQ  

### The Provider isn't working! 
➡️ That can happen. Providers tend to change the parameters of their models or APIs, and then it no longer works. However, all providers are checked weekly, which is a terrible job.  

### Why can I not select a model for Mistral Vibe, Groq Code CLI, and OpenCode?
➡️ These providers do not support model selection via command-line parameters. AI.duino cannot pass a --model flag to them, so no model list is offered. AI.duino uses the CLI default model instead. The model must be configured directly within the CLI tool itself, for example, using the /model command inside an active Mistral Vibe session. 

### "What does 'Invalid JSON response' mean?
➡️ This is an error message from the provider, not AI.duino, usually in html. AI.duino can only parse JSON Messages. This will be fixed soon.  But what is the reason? Your rate is exhausted, there is no more credit on your account.  
  
### "Groq? Really? AI.duino ist supporting Elon??"  
➡️ **No.** **Groq** (with a **q**) is an independent AI infrastructure company founded by former Google engineers. It has no connection to Elon Musk or X/Twitter. **Grok** (with a **k**) is xAI's chatbot. AI.duino uses **Groq** for fast API access to open-source models—a purely technical choice based on performance.

### "And DeepSeek? Can you support it?"  
➡️ **No.** DeepSeek is not supported due to concerns about censorship and data privacy. AI.duino only integrates providers that meet reasonable standards of transparency and user trust. But you can easily modify your providerConfig.js - maybe with help of the AI of your choice. 
  
### "The browser chats have microphone input. Does AI.duino have it?"  
➡️ **No.** Sorry, the IDE itself has no permission to access the microphone for security reasons. Use your OS voice input:  
* Windows: Press WIN + H  
* macOS: Press Fn twice  
* Linux: Use *IBus Typing Booster* with *Voice Input* or install *Nerd Dictation*  

### "Where is the right-click context menu from the IDE in the output window?"  
➡️ The IDE disables right-click for security reasons. Since Copy & Paste is important, AI.duino provides its own workaround menu.  

### "The Quick menu has an unpleasant position. Can it be moved?"  
➡️ **No.** The Quick menu is part of IDE/Theia restricted elements. AI.duino can either have this menu or none at all.
